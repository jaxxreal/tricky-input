# tricky-input

Created with [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) & [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

# Requirements

You need to implement `<Input />` component with following restrictions:

1. You can't use `<input>`, `<textarea>` and `contenteditable` attribute.
2. You can't add event handlers on elements rendered by the `<Input />` component: `addEventListener`, `onChange`, `onClick` and so on.

A minimal version of `<Input />` should be able to move cursor, add and remove character. Any additions are welomce!
